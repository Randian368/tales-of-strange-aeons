  "High above the Nameless Colony of Mars, dangling her legs twenty thousand feet above the city, the cold, fresh air filling her lungs and chilling her skin, Ana Mionar marveled at the sight of the city and felt utterly blessed for the life she was given.",
  "Hundreds of thousands of Cloudwalkers passed by one another in the chaotic air trafic but none of them ever collided.",
  "Millions mingled on the commercial streets without a single occurrence of crime.",
  "Everyone performed their jobs with the utmost efficiency and with the will to the virtue of productive work.",
  "Citizens and visitors alike respected one another as brothers and sisters.",
  "Patches of color and groups of similar architecture deliniated the tens of thousands of independent neighborhoods that offered everyone a place to belong.",
  "There was no illness, no accident, no crime and no violence, no misery and want, no aging and no illness, no war, no ruling elite, no death."
